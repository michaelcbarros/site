                  Waypoint is a donor-supported, tuition-free Christian education project. We deliver a great-books core in Scripture,
                  classical theology, and the liberal arts through online cohorts, clear syllabi, and a curated public-domain library.
                  The emphasis is formation and rigorous study, with straightforward credit pathways for students who need them—so learners
                  focus on reading, discussion, and service rather than cost or bureaucracy.

                  This project develops a grounded-cognition model of how dream simulations help people form and sustain concepts of
                  supernatural agents. It operationalizes “simulation richness” (sensorimotor detail, agency, narrative) in dream reports
                  and examines its relationship to religious and paranormal beliefs. The aim is a mechanistic, embodied alternative to
                  simple “agency-detection” explanations in the cognitive science of religion.

                  An edited volume arguing that religious meaning in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> arises from within the games themselves—
                  mechanics, spaces, symbols, and narrative time—rather than from imported doctrine. Contributors treat ritual performance,
                  sacred time and place, law and normativity, technology and landscape, player phenomenology, and theological motifs,
                  making the case for games as genuine sites of theological reflection.

        <h2>Waypoint Institute</h2>
        <p>Waypoint is a donor-funded, tuition-free Christian education project centered on a great-books core in Scripture, classical theology, and the liberal arts. Cohort-based online delivery, a curated public-domain library, and transfer-friendly partnerships keep the focus on formation and rigorous study. Certificates exist, but the program’s emphasis is education rather than credentialism.</p>

        <h2>Formation of Supernatural Agents in Dreams Through Simulation: A Grounded Cognition Perspective</h2>
        <p>Doctoral dissertation (ABD, National University; proposal stage 2025). Tests whether dream “simulation-richness” predicts religiosity (BMMRS) and paranormal belief (RPBS) using ~1,200 dream reports over 10–14 days (n=120; DREEM subsample n=60 with REM metrics). Codes dreams for sensorimotor simulation, agentic figures, and narrative structure; evaluates REM moderation. Chair: Patrick McNamara.</p>

        <h2>The Legend of Zelda and Religion (edited volume)</h2>
        <p>A multi-author volume arguing that religious forms in Zelda emerge from within the game world—its mechanics, spaces, symbols, and narratives. Topics include ritual performance, sacred time/space, normativity, technology and landscape, player phenomenology, and theological motifs. Prospectus lists 18 contributors; 72–90k words; submission to series editor by March 1, 2026; target publication near the March 2027 film release.</p>
